      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 20 providarties not to disnsent. However, the contract does not explicitly provide specific breach remedies or termination rights for confidentiality breaches beyond general termination provisions in clause 18.2.1 (30-day remedy period for any breach). Recommendation: Add explicit termination rights for material confidentiality breaches and specify remedies including injunctive relief."

      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "The contract includes confidentiality obligations in clause 20 but does not contain a specific liability cap for confidentiality breaches related to Professional Services Data. General indemnity provisions exist in clause 12 but no specific aggregate liability cap is defined for data confidentiality breaches. Recommendation: Add a specific liability cap for breaches of confidentiality obligations relating to Professional Services Data."

      "Confidence": "95%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 20.1 comprehensively addresses disclosure restrictions, requiring parties and their employees, agents, sub-contractors and professional advisers not to disclose Confidential Information without prior written consent. The clause requires treating information confidentially and taking necessary precautions to minimize unauthorized disclosure. Exceptions are clearly defined in clauses 20.2 and 20.3. The provision survives termination per clause 20.6. No gaps identified."

      "Confidence": "90%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 23.1 provides for non-exclusive jurisdiction of English Courts but does not include arbitration provisions. Disputes will be resolved through litigation rather than arbitration. Recommendation: If arbitration is preferred for dispute resolution, add an arbitration clause specifying the arbitration body (e.g., LCIA or SIAC), seat of arbitration, and procedural rules."

      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "The contract does not contain a force majeure clause or provisions allowing performance suspension due to uncontrollable events such as war, fire, natural catastrophes, or other events beyond reasonable control. This creates risk for both parties in case of unforeseen circumstances. Recommendation: Add a comprehensive force majeure clause that suspends performance obligations and provides relief from liability for events beyond reasonable control, with notice requirements and termination rights if the event continues beyond a specified period."

      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 22.1 clearly states that the Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. Clause 23.1 provides for non-exclusive jurisdiction of English Courts. The provisions are clear and comprehensive. No gaps identified."

      "Coverage_status": "Present",
      "Risk_level": "GREEN",
      "Confidence": "90%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 17.1 provides a comprehensive IP indemnity where the Supplier warrants that Supplies will not infringe third party intellectual property rights and indemnifies the Bank and Bank Group from all Losses arising from any claim of IP infringement. The indemnity covers copyright, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, designs and other IP rights. No gaps identified."

      "Confidence": "80%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 17.2 states that IP rights in Deliverables produced by Supplier for the Bank shall belong to and vest in the Bank unless otherwise agreed in an Order, with assignment provisions. Clause 17.4 confirms Bank materials remain with Bank. However, clause 17.5 grants Bank Group unrestricted right to use Supplier materials for receiving benefit of Supplies. This creates some ambiguity - the contract does transfer IP in Deliverables to Bank but preserves Supplier's pre-existing IP. Recommendation: Clarify that only IP in custom Deliverables transfers to Bank while Supplier retains all pre-existing IP and background technology."

      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "The contract does not contain an aggregate liability cap limiting either party's total liability under the agreement. While specific indemnities exist in clauses 12 and 17, there is no overall financial cap on liability. This creates unlimited liability exposure for both parties. Recommendation: Add an aggregate liability cap clause limiting each party's total liability to a multiple of fees paid (e.g., 12 months of fees or total contract value) except for excluded categories such as IP indemnity, confidentiality breaches, fraud, and willful misconduct."

      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "The contract does not contain any exclusion or limitation of consequential, indirect, or special damages such as loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of data, or loss of business opportunity. This creates significant liability exposure for both parties. Recommendation: Add a mutual exclusion clause stating that neither party shall be liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages including loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunity, except for excluded categories such as IP indemnity, confidentiality breaches, and willful misconduct."

      "Confidence": "90%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "The contract lacks comprehensive liability cap and exclusion provisions. While indemnities exist for specific scenarios (IP infringement in clause 17.1, property damage in clause 12.1), there is no overall liability cap or exclusion of consequential damages. This creates unlimited liability exposure. Recommendation: Add comprehensive liability provisions including: (1) aggregate liability cap for each party; (2) exclusion of consequential and indirect damages; (3) carve-outs for IP indemnity, confidentiality breaches, fraud, and willful misconduct; and (4) specific caps for different categories of liability if needed."

      "Confidence": "90%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 18.2.1 provides termination rights for breach with a 30-day remedy period for breaches capable of rectification. Clause 18.2.2 provides immediate termination for insolvency events. Clause 18.3 provides termination for convenience with 30 days notice. The remedy period is clearly specified and reasonable. The provisions adequately protect both parties' interests."

    "Effect of termination and survival provisions": {
      "Priority": "High",
      "Coverage_status": "Partial",
      "Risk_level": "AMBER",
      "Confidence": "80%",
      "Gap Analysis and Recommendations": "Clause 18.4 states that termination shall not affect accrued rights or liabilities at the date of termination. Clause 20.6 specifically states that confidentiality obligations survive termination. However, the contract does not comprehensively list all provisions that survive termination (e.g., IP provisions, indemnities, liability limitations, warranties, payment obligations). Recommendation: Add a comprehensive survival clause explicitly listing all provisions intended to survive termination including confidentiality, IP rights, indemnities, liability limitations, payment obligations, warranties, and dispute resolution provisions."
    }

  "validation_summary_output": {
    "status": "Conditional",
    "notes": "The contract is generally well-structured with comprehensive provisions for confidentiality, IP rights, termination, and governing law. However, several critical gaps exist: (1) No aggregate liability cap limiting total financial exposure; (2) No exclusion of consequential/indirect damages creating unlimited liability risk; (3) No force majeure clause for performance suspension due to uncontrollable events; (4) No arbitration provisions if alternative dispute resolution is preferred; (5) Incomplete survival provisions not comprehensively listing clauses that survive termination. Recommendations: Add aggregate liability cap with appropriate carve-outs, exclude consequential damages, include force majeure clause, add comprehensive survival clause, and consider arbitration provisions if desired. The contract can proceed with these amendments or with appropriate risk acceptance for the identified gaps."
