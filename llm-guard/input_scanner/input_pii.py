# Global Market Outlook

## Fundamentals support equities melt-up

**[Figure 1: Our long-term quantitative model is positive on equities over bonds, despite near-term challenges]**
* **Summary:** A quantitative stock-bond model showing OW (Overweight) equity recommendations from September 2023 to September 2025, with separate bars for Fundamental, Valuation, and Model breadth components. The chart displays varying levels of overweight recommendations ranging from approximately -2 to +5.
* **Key Data Extraction:** The model shows strong positive equity overweight recommendations reaching peaks of approximately +5 in early 2024 and again projected for mid-2025, with current recommendations around +4.
* **Insight/Implication:** Despite near-term market challenges, the quantitative model maintains a consistently bullish stance on equities over bonds, supporting the thesis for continued equity outperformance.

We believe recent macro data and policy efforts support staying Overweight global equities relative to bonds and cash.

A soft landing for the US economy and significant policy support outside the US remain key assumptions behind our expectations for continued corporate earnings growth. Pessimists argue that event risk from a looming potential US government shutdown, elevated equity market valuations, weak seasonality (historically in September-October) and increasingly stretched investor positioning are risks. However, while some short-term volatility or consolidation cannot be ruled out, the still-strong fundamental indicators balance out the negative case, in our view, as indicated by our quantitative stock-bond model, which still favours equities over bonds.

We hold the view that, in this environment, growth equities will outperform high dividend equities.

## The regional trade-offs

Within global equities, Asia ex-Japan remains a preferred region. We are Overweight based on our expectation of a weak USD and continued policy support, especially in the larger economies of China and India. Within Asia, we are Overweight China (with a preference for offshore equities), given growth-supportive policies. We have a core holding for Indian equities and expect recent policy stimulus to help corporate earnings growth to bottom out.

We upgrade US equities to Overweight. The market has witnessed resilient earnings momentum following the last earnings season, led by artificial intelligence-related sectors. This, together with a Fed rate cut supporting our soft-landing view, is why we expect the US to outperform global equities over the next 6-12 months, despite our weak USD view.

We balance these with Underweights in UK and Euro area equities. This is by no means a negative view – indeed we expect both regions can still deliver respectable absolute returns – but the bar to outperform Asia ex-Japan or the US appears more formidable. Indeed, this has been the experience since 2 April: European equities have gained more than 10%, but they have lagged US and Asian peers.

## Adding to Gold allocations

**[Figure 2: Gold expected to sustain gains amid central bank reserve diversification demand and a weak USD]**
* **Summary:** A dual-axis chart showing gold price vs. USD index (DXY, inverted) from September 2024 to September 2025. Gold price ranges from approximately 2,400 to 3,721, while the inverted DXY shows the inverse relationship with USD strength.
* **Key Data Extraction:** Gold price is projected to rise to USD 4,100/oz over the next 6-12 months, representing significant upside from current levels around 2,600-2,800.
* **Insight/Implication:** The inverse correlation between gold and USD strength supports the investment thesis that continued USD weakness will drive substantial gold price appreciation, making it an attractive hedge and diversification tool.

We are adding to our gold allocation. The precious metal has continued to record strong gains since we broke above a tight trading range in September. We expect gains to extend, led by a **resumption of central bank reserve diversification demand and a weak USD. We expect the gold price to rise to USD 4,100/oz over the next 6-12 months.**

Over a shorter horizon, gold also offers an attractive hedge against risks of a rebound in inflation worries, short-term equity volatility or unexpected policy events.

## Prefer non-USD bonds

Our forecast for continued USD weakness means we remain Overweight EM local currency bonds. In an environment where downward pressure on the USD persists, we continue to see value in holding a tilt to non-USD bonds. Besides the currency exposure, rate cuts also lend support. As recently witnessed in several EMs, a rising need for policy measures to support growth, relatively muted inflation and reduced downside pressure on currencies in a weak-USD environment mean central banks are likely to continue cutting rates.

We balance this with an Underweight view on US/European High Yield (HY) bonds. While we acknowledge the asset class should remain well supported in our soft-landing scenario, we believe limited scope for further compression in yield premiums over government bonds makes them less attractive relative to equities in a pro-risk scenario.

In our multi-asset income portfolio, we maintain positive views on US Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) and subordinated financial bonds. The government bond-like credit quality and yield premium over government bonds are leading the performance of MBS bonds. Meanwhile, subordinated financial bond valuations continue to be expensive relative to history and other major bonds. However, we still see them as a pocket of relative value, given broadly elevated valuations across most types of corporate bonds.
